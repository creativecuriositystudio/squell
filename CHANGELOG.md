# 1.0.0-alpha.1

* [CHANGE] Moved to ModelSafe alpha 1.0.0-alpha.1
* [CHANGE] Sequelize models are now correctly serialized to regular ModelSafe model class instances.
  The ModelSafe models were originally only being used as types and not as proper classes,
  which means that helper methods and getters/setters defined were not available.
  This is quite a big change and may break existing code.
* [CHANGE] The `drop` method of queries has been renamed to `skip` in order
  to avoid confusion with the database `drop` term (for destroying a database table/schema)
* [CHANGE] The truncate method of query can now take optional Sequelize truncate options
* [FEATURE] There is now a new `drop` command on queries for dropping database tables

# 0.9.0

* Added `transaction` param to `associate()` to allow association calls to be transacted
* Transacted `associate` and `reload` calls in `create()` and `update()`

# 0.8.1

* Added includeAll() for including all associations on a query
* Fixed an include bug that caused shadowing of assoc ids and thus notNull validation errors
* Lost a minor version along the way somewhere

# 0.7.0

* Bump to ModelSafe `0.7.1`
* Improve the error stack generated by coerced validation errors to allow for easier debugging
  of Sequelize validation errors

# 0.6.2

* Treat plain attributes passed to `order` as a path, and map the path into a
  fully-disambiguous model path. Prevents disambiguous attr names, and allows ordering
  on child attrs
* Add `plain` for creating `PlainAttribute`s easily

# 0.6.1

* Fix include options broken compilation to Sequelize include options

# 0.6.0

* Fix casing of default `through` setting
* Support providing include options in `include` for setting things like `required` off
  or manually overriding the `as` of a eager-load

# 0.5.2

* Fix association saving to support setting associations with an include flag
  even if the association target hasn't come directly from the database (i.e.
  it's a plain JS object instead of a Sequelize instance)

# 0.5.1

* Bump to ModelSafe 0.5.2 for `ValidationError` fixes

# 0.5.0

* Add `findById` operation

# 0.4.0

* Support ModelSafe's new lazy loading association declaration feature
* Add `save` operation to querying that either updates or creates a model instance
  automatically based off the primary key of the model

# 0.3.1

* Re-add `getModelPrimary` as `getInternalModePrimary` to the database class

# 0.3.0

* Migrate to using ModelSafe for model definitions
* Simplify existing code / improve code quality
